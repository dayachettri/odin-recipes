    <h2 class="second-header">What is biryani?</h2>
    <p class="description">
      Biryani is a South Asian rice dish of spiced aromatic rice layered with meat, vegetables, and herbs. Beloved in
      Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and Indian cuisine, biryani has hundreds of regional varieties. It typically involves
      marinating meat in spices and yogurt, parboiling rice with whole spices, and combining the saucy meat with the
      fragrant rice in distinct layers.

      <li>1 (4-inch) piece ginger, thinly sliced</li>

      <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup peanut oil</li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
      <li>½ tsp cumin seeds</li>
      <li>3 whole cloves</li>
      <li>2 green cardamom pods</li>
      <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>½ cup ghee, melted</li>
      <li>1 pinch saffron threads (about 10), soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="steps">Steps:</h3>
    <ol class="step-list">
      <li>
        Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl, combine a third of the fried onions with cilantro, mint, garam masala,
        cayenne pepper, turmeric, garlic, jalapeño, ginger, lemon juice, yogurt, and salt. Add the chicken and toss to
        combine. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the fried onions: Heat the peanut oil and onions in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until
        onion slices separate and begin to turn golden brown, about 25 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the
        onions to a paper towel–lined plate to drain. Reserve oil for another use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, soak and rinse the rice: Rinse rice in 3-4 changes of cold water, then soak in fresh cold water, at
        least 20 minutes before cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parboil the rice: In a large pot, combine cumin, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, salt, and 6 cups water
        over high heat. Bring to a boil, then add rice. Cook rice until slightly tender, about 2–5 minutes. Rice should
        break into two pieces when pressed, not more. Drain rice in a fine mesh strainer, discarding water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer the briyani: In a Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot, spread a third of the parboiled rice on the
        bottom of the pot. Top with half the chicken and its marinade. Top with a third of the remaining fried onions.
        Repeat layering. Drizzle ghee and saffron milk over the final layer of rice. Cover the pot tightly with aluminum
        foil, and then place the lid on top. Steam until chicken is fully cooked, about 35–40 minutes. Garnish with
        remaining fried onions.
      </li>
