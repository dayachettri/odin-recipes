    <h2>What is Indian Butter Chicken</h2>
    <p>
      Indian butter chicken consists of pieces of tandoori chicken cooked in a
      tangy, velvety tomato cream sauce. Despite its rich flavors and hearty
      consistency, butter chicken is a surprisingly low-carb meal.

        Combine yogurt, garlic paste, turmeric, butter, and oil in a medium
        bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Pour yogurt mixture over chicken,
        cover, and return to the refrigerator to marinate for another 3 to 4
        hours.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400°F.</li>

        Place chicken on skewers. Place skewers in a 9x13 inch baking dish and
        bake for 20 minutes at this high heat, until almost cooked through.

        Meanwhile, melt 2 tbsp of butter in a large pot, then add the onion,
        garam masala, remaining teaspoon of chili powder, cumin, ginger, garlic,
