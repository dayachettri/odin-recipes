    <h2>What is palak paneer?</h2>
    <p>
      Palak paneer is a north Indian vegetarian curry with origins in the Punjab
      region. The dish is comprised of a spinach purée (palak is Hindi for
      spinach) and fresh-pressed cheese, with an aromatic blend of spices that
      includes ginger, garlic, and garam masala. Palak paneer is also sometimes
      called saag paneer.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1-2 tablespoons ghee or clarified butter</li>
      <li>2 cups fresh spinach</li>
      <li>1 medium tomato, quartered</li>
      <li>1-inch knob of ginger, peeled and cut into pieces</li>
      <li>5 garlic cloves (3 whole, 2 finely chopped)</li>
      <li>1 green chili (Thai green chilies work well)</li>
      <li>1 large onion, medium diced</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
      <li>¼ tsp turmeric</li>
      <li>¼ tsp cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>¼ tsp ground coriander</li>
      <li>2 tbsp heavy cream</li>
      <li>
        1 cup paneer cheese, cut into 1-inch cubes (or more, to preference)
      </li>
      <li>½ tbsp fenugreek leaves, crushed</li>
      <li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring salted water to a boil in a medium pot. Blanch the spinach leaves
        for 2 minutes, until leaves are bright green. Remove immediately and
        dunk in cold water; drain well. (You can also use frozen spinach; pop in
        the microwave in a bowl with a bit of water before using.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine with tomato, ginger, the whole cloves of garlic, and chili in a
        food processor. Purée until a fine, wet paste forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt ghee in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the chopped garlic,
        and sauté until beginning to brown, and then add the onions. Season with
        salt and pepper, and cook until translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the spinach mixture and water to the pan. Stir to combine, and
        season to taste. Lower stovetop to medium heat and cover, stirring
        occasionally, for about 6-8 minutes, or until thickened to preference.
        If it becomes too thick, adjust with more water.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you've achieved desired consistency, add garam masala, turmeric,
        cayenne, and coriander, and stir to combine. Season to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower heat and add heavy cream and paneer. Simmer for a few minutes,
        until paneer is warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat. Add lemon juice, fenugreek leaves, and stir to
        combine. Season with salt if desired. Serve hot with basmati rice or
        naan bread.
      </li>
    </ol>
